                <h2>What makes us unique?</h2>
                <h3>Innovation score</h3>
                <p>
                    Innovation score is a unique score for novelty and innovation calculated by AAK's Artificial Intelligence. Our AI considers the novelty of the work within the 
                    context of millions of related data-points using published research and industrial vertical indicators. The AI is trained to look for cutting edge, relevant, and 
                    real indications of innovative value across a variety of relevant fields, and assigns a score accordingly.
 
                </p>

                <h3>Vertical relevance</h3>
                <p>
                    Similar to the Innovation Score, the Vertical Relevance Score is another unique score calculated by AAK's Artificial Intelligence within the context of millions of 
                    similar data-points. However, whereas the AI is trained to identify novel, cutting-edge work with the Innovation Score, a valuable complement is identifying how 
                    soundly a work fits into an existing industrial vertical. This latter perspective is identified as the Vertical Relevance Score.
                </p>

                <h3>Project analytics</h3>
                <p>
                    Using our project analytics algorithim,  researchers, investors, and other types of collaborators are identifed, and tailored, for the convience of our users 
                    and their corresponding projects.
